## Project Log

- 2019-08-30 01:03:29: Sketching out the framework of the site.

- 2019-08-30 13:13:24: I am drafting a prefix system for ITCSS that will hopefully help me keep the layers organized more efficiently.

## SCSS Prefixing

The goal of the scss file prefixes is to maintain a sense of which layer the file's components will occupy.
For example, see: <https://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/>

- c-component
  The rules affect a component scope (layer 6), a specific 'thing'

- o-object
  The rules affect an object scope (layer 5), an abstract 

- u-utilities

## FUTURE GOALS:

- 

- Adding font file support:
